# ConsoleDemo

this piece of delphi-code demonstrates how to use a cli (CommandLineInterface), a 
gui (GraphicalUserInterface) and a tmi (TextModeInterface in one executable.

you will be able to widely customize the codes behavior. For Example you'll be able
to let it act like a "real" cli-program if you provide any command-line
parameters, if not it'll look like a "normal" gui-application.

The tmi (TextModeInterface) is almost the same as the cli but on a gui basis.

Feel free to modify&fork the code by your needs.
